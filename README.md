# Catalog-Names-By-First-Letter
I saw on linked in someone say this...

-----------------------------

"Social distancing/isolating by alphabet. 

People with last names that start on
ABC or D:  Try to shop on Mondays
EFG or H:  Try to shop on Tuesdays
IJK or L:  Try to shop on Wednesdays
MNO or P: Try to shop on Thursdays
QRS or T: Try to shop on Fridays
UVW or X: Try to shop on Saturdays
YZ: Try to shop on Sundays

This would further isolate populations without generating undue hardships."

-----------------------------


Then I thought, would it really "further isolate populations without generating undue hardships"?  What if the data was lobsided and it created IMMENSE chaos and DECREASED social distancing during times of pandemic?  Having 40 percent of the people going on one day perhaps?  And 5 percent of the people could go on another?  Wouldn't you want 1/7 of the people go on each day?

So I thought I could code a solution to see how lobsided it could be... as well as giving a solution to divide them through the week equally.



I found some raw data that was a list of names from https://gist.github.com/ruanbekker/a1506f06aa1df06c5a9501cb393626ea

So, thank you ruanbekker!

Quantify and organize list of names into an object based off the first letter in their name.

1.  This is to see how many people's names start with a certain letter.

2.  If you needed to divide these people to do something through the week this would be how it's done equally.
